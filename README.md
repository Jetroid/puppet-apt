Contributing
------------

Contributing is easy, unless you're lazy.

1. Create an Issue and get feedback
2. Fork the project
3. Branch and develop with tests
4. Submit a Pull Request

It is very important that your changes be tested, both via RSpec test and in reality by running via Vagrant. It is also
very important that you don't try and code-fist the project. Keep your development focused on one particular feature or
bug. Small and focused sets of changes are easier to accept as Pull Requests.
